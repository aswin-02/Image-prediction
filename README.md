# Image-processing
An image prediction algorithm implemented using Convolutional Neural Network.

The datasets were collected from [CIFAR-10](https://www.cs.toronto.edu/~kriz/cifar.html), which consists of ten different images of independent beings. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly selected images from each class. The model trains the datasets to attain the pattern and predicts the input data.
